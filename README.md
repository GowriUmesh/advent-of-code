# 🎄 Advent of Code : A month late, still determined

> *“The best time to start Advent of Code was December 12th.  The second-best time is now.”*

While I discovered Advent of code a bit late during a company application process, I decided to commit anyway. 
 The goal isn't speed or rankings, it is consistency and learning in public. 

This is also meant to be a **fun, low-pressure daily ritual**. December had an advent calendar of Maltesers and January gets one made of puzzles. Both are sweet, one is just better for my brain ;)

This repository documents my 12-day sprint through [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, completed intentionally after December: from Jan 12 2026 to Jan 24 2026. 

## 🗓️ Challenge Structure

- **Duration:** 12 days (Jan 12 → Jan 24)
- **Problems:** Advent of Code puzzles
- **Pace:** At least one problem per day

## Final Note

If you’re reading this and thinking about starting late too:  **start anyway.**
