# Day 7: Laboratories
> 🎯 **Goal:**: Analyse the Tachyon manifold diagram to rectify the malfunctioning. 
---
## 📖 Problem Summary
The input is a diagram of a tachyon manifold that must be analyzed to understand the error.
A beam enters from a starting point and travels downward through a grid, splitting into multiple paths whenever it encounters a splitter.

In the classical manifold, the task is to count how many times the beam splits.
In the quantum manifold, a single particle follows all possible paths, and the goal is to count the total number of resulting timelines.

They keep calling you back.* 🔄
## 💻 Usage
1. Place your puzzle input in a text file (`input.txt`)
2. Run the solution script  with the input file as an argument:
```bash
# classical
./laboratories.py input.txt --classic

# For quantum analysis
./laboratories.py input.txt --quantum
```
